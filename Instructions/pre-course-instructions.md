### 2. Install R and R studio

We’re going to get you up and running in R which is a highly respected, free statistics package used by academics around the world. We will also install a friendly interface to R called RStudio.

Download and install RStudio. This is a nice interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There should be an ‘installer’ for your operating system. You want the FREE desktop version.


### 4. Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.

Workshop 7 of this course allows you to put some of what you have learnt into practise. You can either come in with your own dataset, and let us help you get started, or you can continue using the data we have provided.
