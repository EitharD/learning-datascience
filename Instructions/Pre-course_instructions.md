# Course Pre-requisites 

The teaching will be hands-on, so participants need to bring their own laptops to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. In exchange, you will leave with a working version of R, and the skills to use it.

This course assumes no prior knowledge of the tools, but working through the course requires working copies of the software described below. We recommend you install the programmes below before the course begins. 

Please note all of the requirements specified below are free. Get in contact if you are about to hand over any money when setting up the pre-requisites, because you shouldn't be.

## Pre-course Objectives

- Install R

- Install R studio

- Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.

## Steps

### 1. Charge your laptop

We’ll provide a power bar, but it will be easier if you begin with a fully charged laptop. Don't forget to bring your laptop and power cord with you, as the course requires you to use your laptop continuously during the 2 days. 

### 2. Install R and R studio

We’re going to get you up and running in R which is a highly respected, free statistics package used by academics around the world. We will also install a friendly interface to R called RStudio.

Download and install R from [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

Download and install RStudio. This is a nice interface for R, and the easiest way to use it. Download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There should be an ‘installer’ for your operating system. You want the FREE desktop version.


### 4. Decide on the dataset you want to use for practice.
The course is ran on a synthetic version of the CCHIC database, which is a Critical Care Collaboration across trusts. This is not real patient data, but is made to look real! You will all have access to this dataset. 

Workshop 7 of this course allows you to put some of what you have learnt into practise. You can either come in with your own dataset, and let us help you get started, or you can continue using the synthetic CCHIC dataset. 

If you have problems with installing software, there is a small amount of setup time allocated for this at the beginning of the course. Bring your laptop, and we will be happy to help.

See you there!
