## Hello!

- Pre-requisites
- Course schedule

## Pre-requisites

- If need to run locally use these links to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- 
- Collaborative google document [todo add link to googledoc here]



## Course schedule
- 2 days of intensive learning

[todo : add updated schedule here from the readme]


## The Data


[todo probably replace this data section to refer to the new data]
- We use the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative dataset.

- Multicentre Adult ITU database
    - 11 adult ICUs
    - 5 UK teaching hospitals
    - Privacy ensured through “highest standards of data security”
    - 18, 074 unique patients
- You will be using a synthetically derived dataset structured in a similar format to the CCHIC data. 
- Data looks real, but isn't.


## What to expect from the sessions

- we will follow a learning by doing approach
-- getting you interacting with R early

- don't worry if you don't understand everything at the start
- do feel free to ask us questions at any time

- we apologise in advance for when we 
-- a) assume you know something that you don't
-- b) patronise you by explaining something you already know

We expect to do both and please feel free to tell us when we are.


# Thank you. We hope you enjoy the course.
