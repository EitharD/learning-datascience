# UCLH Data Science Fellows training August 2021

**in development**

This repository contains the training materials for a two day course introducing R for the manipulation and visualisation of patient data. It assumes no knowledge of R, but is structured so that those know some R can also gain insights.


The main aim of the course is to develop the capacity of clinicians to use R and other modern data tools to manipulate hospital generated patient data. 


The course uses patient data from UCLH related to the covid pandemic.


In the longer term the aim is to help clinicians develop modern, reproducible data workflows – ‘good enough’ scientific computing - to make their work more efficient. We will be working to improve the interfaces between these practices and the hospital data systems.


See the Instructions folder for more information.
